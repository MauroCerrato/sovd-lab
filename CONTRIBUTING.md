# Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution! To keep this lab IP-safe and reusable:

- **No confidential data** (no real VINs/brand identifiers). Use synthetic examples only.
- **No copy-paste** from ISO/ASAM texts. Summaries in your own words only.
- Add SPDX headers to code files: `SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`.
- Documentation is **CC BY 4.0**; synthetic data is **CC0**.
- If you contribute to Eclipse OpenSOVD upstream, ensure you have a signed **Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA)** and use the same email in commits.

## How to contribute here
1. Create an issue with a **user story** and acceptance criteria.
2. Fork and open a PR referencing the issue.
3. Ensure CI passes (lint, license headers, links).
