## ADS GTR Relevance for Parking & Low-Speed Manoeuvres

The ADS GTR (draft structure from GRVA ADS IWG) distinguishes between:
- **ADS features performing the entire DDT** (L3/L4/L5), and
- **DCAS / ACSF functions** that support the driver (L2).

“Park Pilot” and “Remote Controlled Parking” remain **L2** unless the system can **perform the entire DDT** within a **defined ODD without human fallback** (e.g., AVP Type-2 in an approved garage).  
L4 AVP is modeled as:
- A **confined, infrastructure-supported ODD** (garage with digital map, approved operating envelope),
- **No human fallback**,  
- **DDT fallback executed by the AVP system**,  
- Validation via **scenario-families**, **operational safety monitoring**, and **facility-level approval** (e.g., DE KBA TRC).
