\#Overview
SMS (Safety Management System) is central in the ADS regulatory path; audits review claims/arguments/evidence and continuous improvement. 

Use KPIs that are measurable and tie into ISMR and SUMS

Proposed KPI shortlist (synthetic):

	Hazard closure lead time (median/95th percentile, days) — from detection to mitigation validated.
	Update validation cycle time (days) — SUMS change → validation → rollout → post-deployment verification.
	Field anomaly detection latency (minutes/hours) — event→alert pipeline.
	TOR efficacy (% acknowledged within deadline; % resolved without MRM).
	MRM incidence rate per 1,000 ADS-active hours (with breakdown of triggers).
	Virtual toolchain correlation confidence (unitless score) — lab vs track vs real-world delta bands (feeds the credibility narrative highlighted in WS09).
	Supplier non-conformity resolution time (days) — relevant to CSMS/SUMS ecosystem.


I am keeping KPI names generic and synthetic thresholds definitions; both KPIs and thresholds should not reproduce any UNECE audit checklists verbatim.
